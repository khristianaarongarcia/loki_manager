# If false, Depo will only log missing dependencies and not download them.
auto-download: true

# If true, soft dependencies (softdepend) are also auto-downloaded.
# Default false: only hard 'depend' entries auto-download; soft ones are reported.

# Optional automatic update of already-installed dependencies.
# Currently not implemented; reserved for future use.

# Repository priority. Valid values: [modrinth, spiget]
# Depo will try the first repository, then fall back to the other.

# Manual overrides for specific plugin dependencies.
# Map plugin name (as referenced in plugin.yml depend/softdepend) to a direct JAR URL.
# Example:
# overrides:
#   Vault: "https://example.com/Vault-1.0.jar"
overrides: {}

# Aliases: treat a dependency name as provided by another installed plugin name.
# Example maps Vault -> ComplexVault, so ComplexVault satisfies a dependency on Vault.
aliases: {}

# Optional checksums: map plugin name to lowercase hex SHA-256 to validate downloads
checksums: {}

# Optional version constraints for dependencies.
# Map plugin name -> constraint expression.
# Supported forms:
#   1.2.3            (exact)
#   >=1.2.0          (comparators: >, >=, <, <=)
#   ^1.2.3           (caret: compatible with 1.x, >=1.2.3 <2.0.0)
#   ~1.2.3           (tilde: >=1.2.3 <1.3.0)
#   1.2.x            (wildcard patch)
#   1.x              (wildcard minor/patch)
#   1.2.0 - 1.4.5    (range inclusive)
# If a constraint is specified and no matching version is found in repositories, the dependency will not be downloaded.
